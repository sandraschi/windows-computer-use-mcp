# 🔥 Python Dependency Hell - The Great 3.13 Catastrophe of October 2025

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL - All MCP servers broken  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Lesson**: Dependency hell was not invented on a whim!

---

## 🚨 **The Disaster**

**What Happened**:
- A server imported a tool incompatible with Python 3.13
- Cursor installed **Python 3.10** as a workaround (became default)
- Config files (`pyproject.toml`) still demanded Python 3.13
- **RESULT**: All MCP servers broke with `TypeError: 'function' object is not subscriptable'`

---

## 📊 **Timeline**

| Time | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| ~1 week ago | Started using Python 3.13 | Seemed fine initially |
| Early Oct 2025 | Installed incompatible tool | Broke one server |
| Oct 7, 2025 | Cursor auto-installed Python 3.10 | All servers stopped working |
| Oct 8, 2025 | Fixed with version constraints | ✅ Servers working again |

---

## 💥 **The Error**

**Symptom**:
```
TypeError: 'function' object is not subscriptable
  File "...\mcp\server\session.py", line 96, in __init__
    self._incoming_message_stream_writer, self._incoming_message_stream_reader = anyio.create_memory_object_stream[
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^
        ServerRequestResponder
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    ](0)
    ^
```

**Affected servers**:
- ❌ notepadpp-mcp
- ❌ advanced-memory-mcp
- ❌ rtorrent-mcp
- ❌ Most other MCP servers

**Servers that worked**:
- ✅ basic-memory (already had fix)

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Problem 1: MCP SDK 1.16.0 Breaking Change**

**IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION**:
- ✅ Python 3.13 worked fine for MONTHS with MCP 1.14.1
- ❌ MCP SDK 1.16.0 introduced Python 3.13 incompatibility
- **It's not Python 3.13's fault - it's MCP 1.16.0!**

**What happened**:
- **Sept 2025**: Python 3.13 + MCP 1.14.1 + FastMCP 2.12.3 = ✅ Working
- **Oct 7, 2025**: Package auto-updated to MCP 1.16.0
- **MCP 1.16.0** broke Python 3.13 compatibility
- Generic type syntax `anyio.create_memory_object_stream[Type]` now fails

**MCP ecosystem status** (Oct 2025):
- `mcp` **1.14.1**: ✅ Python 3.13 compatible
- `mcp` **1.16.0**: ❌ Python 3.13 broken
- `fastmcp`: Works with either, depends on MCP version

### **Problem 2: Auto-Update to MCP 1.16.0**

**What was working** (September 2025):
```toml
# Python 3.13 + these packages worked perfectly:
fastmcp==2.12.3
mcp==1.14.1  # ← This version was fine with 3.13!
```

**What broke** (October 2025):
```toml
# Auto-update pulled new version:
fastmcp>=2.12.0  # Pulled 2.12.4
# Which pulled: mcp==1.16.0  ← This broke 3.13!
```

**What happened**:
1. `fastmcp>=2.12.0` auto-upgraded to 2.12.4
2. FastMCP 2.12.4 pulled MCP 1.16.0
3. **MCP 1.16.0 broke Python 3.13 compatibility**
4. All servers using 3.13 crashed with `TypeError`
5. **BOOM!** 💥

---

## ✅ **The Fix - THREE OPTIONS**

### **Option A: Downgrade MCP (Keep Python 3.13)** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED IF YOU LIKE 3.13**

**Go back to the version that worked**:
```bash
pip uninstall fastmcp mcp -y
pip install fastmcp==2.12.3 mcp==1.14.1
```

**Update your requirements.txt**:
```python
fastmcp==2.12.3
mcp==1.14.1
```

**Result**: ✅ Python 3.13 works again!

---

### **Option B: Downgrade Python (Keep MCP 1.16.0)** - Current Solution

**Switch to Python 3.10**:
```toml
requires-python = ">=3.10"
```

**Why**: Python 3.10 works with all MCP versions, including 1.16.0.

---

### **Option C: Wait for Fix**

**Wait for**:
- MCP 1.17.0 or later with Python 3.13 fix
- Check https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk

---

### **Step 2: Constrain Package Versions**

**Update `requirements.txt`**:
```python
# Notepad++ MCP Server Requirements
# Compatible with Python 3.10+
# Windows only

fastmcp>=2.12.0
mcp>=1.0.0,<2.0.0      # ← CRITICAL: Pin to 1.x
anyio>=4.0.0,<5.0.0    # ← CRITICAL: Prevent incompatible versions
psutil>=5.9.0
pywin32==311; platform_system=='Windows'
requests>=2.31.0
```

**Update `pyproject.toml`**:
```toml
[project]
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = [
    "fastmcp>=2.12.0",
    "mcp>=1.0.0,<2.0.0",     # ← CRITICAL
    "anyio>=4.0.0,<5.0.0",   # ← CRITICAL
    "psutil>=5.9.0",
    "pywin32==311; platform_system=='Windows'",
    "requests>=2.31.0",
]
```

---

### **Step 3: Reinstall Packages**

```bash
# Remove broken packages
pip uninstall fastmcp mcp anyio -y

# Reinstall with constraints
pip install "fastmcp>=2.12.0" "mcp>=1.0.0,<2.0.0" "anyio>=4.0.0,<5.0.0"

# Or just reinstall from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **Step 4: Verify**

```bash
# Test server startup
python -m notepadpp_mcp.tools.server

# Should see:
# ✅ FastMCP 2.12.4
# ✅ MCP SDK 1.16.0
# ✅ No TypeError!
```

---

## 🎯 **The Fix - Quick Reference Card**

**Copy-paste this into ANY broken MCP server:**

### **requirements.txt**:
```python
fastmcp>=2.12.0
mcp>=1.0.0,<2.0.0
anyio>=4.0.0,<5.0.0
```

### **pyproject.toml**:
```toml
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = [
    "fastmcp>=2.12.0",
    "mcp>=1.0.0,<2.0.0",
    "anyio>=4.0.0,<5.0.0",
    # ... other deps
]
```

### **Then run**:
```bash
pip uninstall fastmcp mcp anyio -y
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**DONE!** ✅

---

## 📚 **Lessons Learned**

### **1. It Wasn't Python 3.13's Fault!**

**What we THOUGHT**:
- Python 3.13 is too new
- Breaking changes in 3.13 caused issues
- Should stick with 3.10

**What ACTUALLY happened**:
- ✅ Python 3.13 worked perfectly for MONTHS
- ❌ **MCP SDK 1.16.0 broke Python 3.13 compatibility**
- The problem was the package update, not Python itself!

**Rule**: **Pin your MCP version** or be ready for breakage

---

### **2. Always Pin Versions (ESPECIALLY MCP!)**

**What broke us**:
```python
fastmcp>=2.12.0  # Auto-pulled MCP 1.16.0 and broke everything!
```

**What worked**:
```python
fastmcp==2.12.3  # Exact version
mcp==1.14.1      # Exact version - worked with Python 3.13
```

**Or use constraints**:
```python
fastmcp>=2.12.0,<2.13.0
mcp>=1.14.0,<1.16.0  # Avoid 1.16.0!
```

**Why**: **MCP 1.16.0 specifically broke Python 3.13**. Pin to avoid surprises!

---

### **3. Dependency Hell is Real**

**The term was not invented on a whim!**

**What happened**:
1. We wanted Python 3.13
2. MCP required older `anyio`
3. But newer tools required newer packages
4. **Conflict!** Everything broke

**Solution**: 
- Document known-good versions
- Test before upgrading
- Have rollback plan

---

## 🛠️ **Applying to Other Servers**

### **For advanced-memory-mcp**:

```bash
cd D:\Dev\repos\advanced-memory-mcp

# Edit requirements.txt - add:
# mcp>=1.0.0,<2.0.0
# anyio>=4.0.0,<5.0.0

# Reinstall
pip uninstall fastmcp mcp anyio -y
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test
python -m advanced_memory_mcp.server
```

---

### **For rtorrent-mcp**:

```bash
cd D:\Dev\repos\rtorrent-mcp

# Same process
# Edit requirements.txt
# Reinstall packages
# Test
```

---

### **For ANY MCP Server**:

**Universal fix**:
1. Set `requires-python = ">=3.10"`
2. Add `mcp>=1.0.0,<2.0.0` to dependencies
3. Add `anyio>=4.0.0,<5.0.0` to dependencies
4. Uninstall and reinstall packages
5. Test server startup

---

## 📊 **Version Compatibility Matrix**

| Python | MCP | fastmcp | Status | Notes |
|--------|-----|---------|--------|-------|
| 3.10 | 1.14.1 | 2.12.3 | ✅ Works | Stable |
| 3.10 | 1.16.0 | 2.12.4 | ✅ Works | Current fix |
| 3.13 | 1.14.1 | 2.12.3 | ✅ Works | **Worked for months!** |
| 3.13 | 1.16.0 | 2.12.4 | ❌ BREAKS | **MCP 1.16.0 broke 3.13!** |

**Key finding**: MCP 1.14.1 works with Python 3.13, but MCP 1.16.0 doesn't!

**As of**: October 2025

---

## 🔮 **Can We Use Python 3.13 NOW?**

**YES! Just use the old MCP version**:

```bash
pip install fastmcp==2.12.3 mcp==1.14.1
```

**This combination worked for months!**

**Or wait for**:
1. MCP 1.17.0+ with Python 3.13 fix
2. Check release notes at https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk

**Update**: You CAN use Python 3.13, just not with MCP 1.16.0 specifically!

---

## 💡 **Prevention - Future-Proofing**

### **1. Document Known-Good Versions**

Create `TESTED_VERSIONS.md`:
```markdown
# Last tested: October 8, 2025

- Python: 3.10.11 ✅
- fastmcp: 2.12.4 ✅
- mcp: 1.16.0 ✅
- anyio: 4.11.0 ✅
```

---

### **2. Use Virtual Environments**

```bash
# Per-project isolation
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Why**: Prevents global package conflicts.

---

### **3. Lock Dependencies**

Use `pip freeze` after confirming things work:

```bash
# After successful install
pip freeze > requirements-lock.txt

# To reproduce exactly
pip install -r requirements-lock.txt
```

---

### **4. Add Pre-commit Hooks**

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: check-python-version
      name: Check Python version
      entry: python -c "import sys; assert sys.version_info[:2] == (3, 10)"
      language: system
```

## 🎓 **Wisdom from the Trenches**

### **Quote of the Day**:
> "Dependency hell was not invented on a whim!"  
> *— Sandra, after fixing 10+ broken MCP servers*

### **Truths Discovered**:

1. **Newer ≠ Better**
   - Python 3.13 looks shiny
   - Python 3.10 actually works
   - Choose reliability over novelty

2. **Pin Everything**
   - `>=2.0.0` is an invitation to disaster
   - `>=2.0.0,<3.0.0` is sanity
   - Document WHY you pinned versions

3. **Test Incrementally**
   - Don't upgrade everything at once
   - Test one package at a time
   - Have a rollback plan

4. **Listen to Your Gut (But Investigate!)**
   - "3.13 seems like hassle" felt right
   - But turned out 3.13 worked fine for months!
   - The real issue was MCP 1.16.0
   - Trust your instincts, but verify the root cause

5. **AI Isn't Always Right (Including Me!)**
   - I blamed Python 3.13
   - Actually it was MCP 1.16.0
   - Always check the timeline
   - Question assumptions (even from AI!)

## 📝 **Checklist: Fixing a Broken MCP Server**

- [ ] Identify error: `TypeError: 'function' object is not subscriptable'`
- [ ] Check Python version: `python --version`
- [ ] Check if Python 3.13: If yes, that's likely the problem
- [ ] Update `requirements.txt`:
  - [ ] Add `mcp>=1.0.0,<2.0.0`
  - [ ] Add `anyio>=4.0.0,<5.0.0`
- [ ] Update `pyproject.toml`:
  - [ ] Set `requires-python = ">=3.10"`
  - [ ] Add same version constraints
- [ ] Uninstall broken packages: `pip uninstall fastmcp mcp anyio -y`
- [ ] Reinstall: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] Test: `python -m <server_module>`
- [ ] Verify: Look for FastMCP banner, no errors
- [ ] Document: Note the fix in your server's README

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

**Server is fixed when**:
✅ Server starts without errors  
✅ FastMCP banner displays  
✅ No `TypeError` about subscripting  
✅ Appears in Claude Desktop MCP list  
✅ Tools are callable  

---

## 📞 **Still Broken?**

**If this fix doesn't work**:

1. **Check other dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip list | grep -E "mcp|fastmcp|anyio|pydantic"
   ```

2. **Try clean install**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .venv
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Check for conflicts**:
   ```bash
   pip check
   ```

4. **Verify Python version**:
   ```bash
   python --version  # Should be 3.10.x or 3.11.x
   ```

5. **Check server logs**:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp-server-<name>.log`
   - Look for detailed error messages

---

## 🏆 **The Moral of the Story**

**Technology Stack Wisdom**:

1. **Stable > Shiny**
   - Use proven versions
   - Wait for ecosystem to catch up
   - Don't be an early adopter in production

2. **Pin Your Dependencies**
   - Explicit is better than implicit
   - Version ranges prevent surprises
   - Document why versions are pinned

3. **Test Before Upgrading**
   - One component at a time
   - In isolated environment first
   - Have rollback ready

4. **Trust Your Instincts**
   - "Not worth the hassle" was right
   - Experience matters
   - Question recommendations

5. **Document Everything**
   - Future you will thank you
   - Dependency hell will return
   - Solutions get forgotten
